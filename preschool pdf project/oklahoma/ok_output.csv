page_18.png,Communication skills and literacy development play an essential role in all domains of learning. Between birth and age three  children begin communicating through sounds  gestures and emotions and move to convey ideas  thoughts and feelings through beginning language. A child's cooing and raising eyebrows leads to babbling  first words and expressing him/ herself using spoken language  sign language or other methods of communicating. Special consideration should be given to those young children whose primary language  the language a person acquires first in life  is not English. Assist the English Language Learner by building on what the young child may already know in his/her primary language.,standard,,1.1
page_18.png,An environment filled with spoken and printed language supports building children's language skills. Typically when very young children are surrounded by people talking or who talk with them  they begin to repeat what they hear and imitate conversations. When infants  toddlers and twos observe people reading and have opportunities to look at books  they learn reading is important. Marks on a page may eventually be associated with meaning and words leading young children to imitate the sounds that may begin to look like letters and numbers. Early language and literacy experiences are the building blocks for life-long learning.,standard,,1.2
