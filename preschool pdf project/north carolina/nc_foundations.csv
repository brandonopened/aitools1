They move from turning over to sitting up, from crawling to walking, and then from running to playing organized games.

Early childhood programs can promote physical development by providing children with a safe, supervised environment where play is encouraged and children have ample opportunities to explore.",explanatory,,

Understanding what those cries mean and how best to respond to them helps set the stage for the more com- plicated language skills that will develop over the next several years. Language and early literacy development is also closely entwined with social-emotional and cogni- tive development as children grow and mature. Language development progresses most rapidly during the first five years of a child's life, occurring within the context of relationships. Although some language development milestones are shared across groups, there are also differences, based on cultural and linguistic backgrounds (e.g., single versus multiple language exposure).",definition,,
page_60.png,"Language development includes learning the meaning of words and concepts, the development of concepts, the ability to express oneself and understand others, and the development of grammar. Early literacy focuses on emerging skills related to reading and writing, such as understanding how books work or that printed letters represent spoken language. Children typically learn the skills for reading and writing during early childhood and begin to be readers and writers during elementary school years (Literacy Basics, 2021). Stages of development (pre-reader, novice reader, decoding reader, fluent com- prehending reader, and expert reader), however, are not necessarily strongly tied to age (Reutzel & Cooter, 2015).
