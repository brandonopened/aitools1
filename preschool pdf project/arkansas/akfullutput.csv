Young children who live in poverty, lack stable relationships at home, live with drug- or alcohol-dependent caregivers, or who are exposed to other adverse conditions may face more challenges in engaging in physical activity and supporting their own nutrition and health. These children may require more intense positive interactions and learning opportunities to support their physical development and health.",Indicator,ADAPTATIONS
page_18.png,,"Children's cultural background may play a role in how they develop and meet physical development and health milestones. Children's development in certain areas is dependent on the exposure they have to certain activities and opportunities to practice certain skills. For example, girls in some cultures may not be exposed to riding a bike or other physical activities. Similarly, a child's demonstration of fine motor skills using utensils may depend on whether early self-help skills such as feeding oneself are expected and taught in their family and culture, and use of utensils may vary across cultures.",Indicator,CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS
page_18.png,,"Children with physical disabilities should be included in physical activities, but may require alternate ways of meeting gross and fine motor indicators. These children may pedal an adaptive tricycle, navigate a wheelchair, or feed themselves with a specialized spoon. Children with cognitive disabilities may also meet the physical development and health goals in a different way, often at a different pace, with a different degree of accomplishment, and in a different order than typically developing children. When observing how children demonstrate what they know and can do, early childhood professionals must consider appropriate adaptations and modifications, as necessary.",Indicator,DISABILITIES
page_18.png,,"A key consideration in promoting physical development is the safety of the children involved in physical activities. Wearing the appropriate safety equipment during a physical activity, not swinging an object when others are close, and providing adequate space to allow children the ability to move without bumping into others are key elements of safety when engaging in physical activity.",Indicator,SAFETY
