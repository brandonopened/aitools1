┃ 1. **Introduction (5-10 minutes):**                                                                              ┃
┃    - Gather the children in a comfortable reading area. Begin with a short discussion about families. Ask, "Who  ┃
┃ is in your family?" Encourage children to name some family members.                                              ┃
┃    - Show the children each flashcard with a family member on it. Point to the picture, say the word clearly,    ┃
┃ and have the children repeat it. For example, "This is a mother. Can you say 'mother'?"                          ┃
┃                                                                                                                  ┃
┃ 2. **Storytime (10-15 minutes):**                                                                                ┃
┃    - Introduce the book by showing the cover and asking the children what they see. Engage them with questions   ┃
┃ like, "What do you think this story is about?" or "Who can tell me what a family is?"                            ┃
┃    - Read the book aloud, using expressive tones and gestures. Emphasize vocabulary related to family members    ┃
┃ and actions, such as "hug," "love," or "care." Pause occasionally to ask questions about the illustrations or to ┃
┃ invite the children to predict what will happen next.                                                            ┃
┃                                                                                                                  ┃
┃ 3. **Interactive Discussion (5-10 minutes):**                                                                    ┃
┃    - After the story, use the puppets to reenact a short scene from the book. Ask the children to identify each  ┃
┃ puppet and the family member it represents.                                                                      ┃
┃    - Then, have a brief show-and-tell session where each child is asked to say one sentence about a family       ┃
┃ member, using phrases like "My brother loves to play." Encourage them to use new vocabulary from the book.       ┃
┃                                                                                                                  ┃
┃ 4. **Creative Activity (15-20 minutes):**                                                                        ┃
┃    - Provide each child with a blank piece of paper and crayons or markers. Encourage them to draw a picture of  ┃
┃ their family. Offer to write the names of the family members they draw if they are not yet writing.              ┃
┃    - As they draw, walk around the room and have individual conversations with the children about their          ┃
┃ drawings. Use questions to encourage expanded responses, such as "Who is this?" or "What does your sister like   ┃
┃ to do?"                                                                                                          ┃
┃                                                                                                                  ┃
┃ 5. **Closing (5 minutes):**                                                                                      ┃
┃    - Invite each child to show their drawing to the group and explain who they drew. This will not only          ┃
┃ reinforce vocabulary but also build confidence in speaking in front of peers.                                    ┃
┃    - Finish with a group cheer for "our wonderful families!" Encourage the use of new vocabulary one last time   ┃
┃ in a closing wrap-up sentence, such as "Families are fun!"                                                       ┃
┃                                                                                                                  ┃
┃ **Extensions:**                                                                                                  ┃
┃ - Create a family-themed bulletin board with the children's drawings. Label the drawings with words like         ┃
┃ "Mother," "Father," etc., as mentioned in their pictures.                                                        ┃
┃ - Send home a short note to parents with suggestions for related vocabulary activities they can try at home,     ┃
┃ like going through a family photo album together and naming members.                                             ┃
┃                                                                                                                  ┃
┃ Through this multifaceted activity, toddlers will not only learn key vocabulary related to their immediate       ┃
┃ family but also enhance their listening, speaking, and creative expression skills.                               ┃
┃                                                                                                                  ┃

┃    - Teach the children the "Finger Family Song," using your hand as a visual guide, where each finger           ┃
┃ represents a family member.                                                                                      ┃

┃    Lead the toddlers to each zone. Encourage them to say the name of each family member while pointing to the zones.   ┃
┃ For example, guide them by saying, "Let's go to Daddy's Zone! Can you say 'Daddy'?"                                    ┃

┃ scenarios, such as, "In Mommy's Zone, what do you like to do? Pretend you're talking on the phone. Can you say         ┃
┃ 'Hello'?" or "In Sister's Zone, do you want to play with the toy car together?"                                        ┃

┃    Play the family-themed music. Encourage toddlers to dance or act out actions related to the lyrics, like giving a   ┃

┃    Gather the children together and recap the activity. Ask them to say one thing about each family zone they visited. ┃
┃ Use prompts like, "What did we play in Daddy's Zone?"                                                                  ┃

┃   - "What do you call your mom and dad?"                                                                               ┃
┃   - "Do you have any brothers or sisters?"                                                                             ┃
┃   Encourage each child to share a little bit about their family.                                                       ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ #### 2. Photo Sharing (if applicable)                                                                                  ┃
┃ - **Family Photos:** If parents have provided family photos, allow each child a moment to show and tell stories about  ┃
┃ their family based on the pictures. This promotes vocabulary as they name each family member and say something about   ┃
┃ them.                                                                                                                  ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ #### 3. Craft Activity: "My Family Tree"                                                                               ┃
┃ - **Create Family Trees:** Provide paper and craft supplies for each child. Guide them in drawing simple family trees. ┃
┃ Assist them in labeling members (mom, dad, sister, brother, etc.) using pre-written labels if necessary.               ┃
┃ - **Decorate:** Let the toddlers decorate their family trees with drawings or stickers, enhancing fine motor skills    ┃
┃ and creativity.                                                                                                        ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ #### 4. Puppet Play                                                                                                    ┃
┃ - **Role-Playing:** Use small puppets or dolls to role-play family scenarios. This activity can be led by asking the   ┃
┃ children to mimic typical family interactions, such as a family dinner or playing in the park.                         ┃
┃ - **Encourage Dialogue:** Prompt the kids with phrases like, "Let's say hello to our family," and encourage them to    ┃
┃ use greetings and simple sentences, developing conversational skills.                                                  ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ #### 5. Transition to Music and Movement                                                                               ┃
┃ - **Song Time:** Conclude the activity with music. Play family-themed songs (like "We Are Family") and lead a          ┃
┃ sing-along and dance session.                                                                                          ┃
┃ - **Include Actions:** Incorporate simple actions related to the lyrics to reinforce language and understanding, such  ┃
┃ as waving for 'hello' and hugging motions for 'family.'                                                                ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ #### 6. Wrap-Up and Recap                                                                                              ┃
┃ - **Review Vocabulary:** End the session by reviewing new words learned, and provide a chance for each child to say    ┃
┃ one new thing they learned about families.                                                                             ┃
┃ - **Parent Interaction:** Pass along the family trees with a note encouraging parents to talk about family members at  ┃
┃ home, supporting continuity in learning.                                                                               ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ **Outcome:**                                                                                                           ┃
┃ By the end of the activity, toddlers should have a better understanding of family vocabulary and increased ability to  ┃
┃ communicate about their family. The activities should stimulate their language skills, enhance their social            ┃
┃ interaction, and provide a foundation for talking about relationships.                                                 ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃

┃    - Show the children a family photo album or a few selected printed photographs. Introduce each family member one by ┃
┃ one, naming them and pointing to their faces.                                                                          ┃
┃    - Encourage the toddlers to repeat the family names after you. Use simple phrases like, "This is Mommy," "This is   ┃
┃ Daddy," "This is me," etc.                                                                                             ┃

┃    - Give each child a piece of construction paper and crayons or markers.                                             ┃
┃    - Have them draw a big tree or use a pre-drawn template.                                                            ┃
┃    - Provide cut-outs of family member faces from the photos you’ve shown. Help the toddlers glue the family faces     ┃
┃ onto the tree template, starting with themselves at the base of the tree.                                              ┃
┃    - As they glue, reiterate the names of the family members, e.g., "Let’s put Grandma on the tree," and have the      ┃
┃ toddlers repeat.                                                                                                       ┃

┃ 4. **Role-Playing with Names (10 minutes):**                                                                           ┃
┃    - Use laminated name cards to match with the photos they've used. Show a name card and ask them to match it with    ┃
┃ the correct family face on their tree.                                                                                 ┃
┃    - Encourage them to use simple sentences such as "Dad is here," or "This is my brother."                            ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 5. **Mirror Game (5 minutes):**                                                                                        ┃
┃    - Stand in front of the mirror with the toddlers and have them say their names while looking at themselves.         ┃
┃ Reinforce with, "Hi, I’m [Name], this is my family," to connect their reflection with their personal identity.         ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃

┃    - Conclude the session by sitting in a circle. Ask each child to hold up their family tree creation and name each   ┃
┃ family member as a group.                                                                                              ┃
┃    - End with a follow-the-leader style "goodbye" song where each family member is mentioned.                          ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃

┃ - Send home a “Family Word Book” where parents can help their child add more family names and photos, drawing or       ┃
┃ sticking and labeling under their supervision. Encourage parents to review and discuss these photos daily with their   ┃
┃ children to reinforce learning.                                                                                        ┃

┃ #### Additional Tips:                                                                                                  ┃
┃ - Use positive reinforcement each time they correctly identify a family member.                                        ┃
┃ - Maintain patience and encourage participation, even if toddlers choose only to observe at first.                     ┃
┃ - Adapt and repeat the activity throughout the week to strengthen recognition and vocabulary retention.                ┃

┃    - Begin with a circle time discussion about families. Ask each child to share who is in their family. Use           ┃
┃ illustrated family flashcards to help them understand and name each family role (e.g., mother, father, sibling).       ┃
┃    - Introduce the word 'bookcase' and explain that just like a book holds stories, our bookcase will hold our family  ┃
┃ words.                                                                                                                 ┃

┃ 2. **Interactive Storytime:**                                                                                          ┃
┃    - Read a book about families, such as "The Family Book" by Todd Parr. Encourage children to point out and repeat    ┃
┃ family-related words.                                                                                                  ┃
┃    - Incorporate action by asking children to stand when they hear specific family words during the story.             ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 3. **Create a Family Book:**                                                                                           ┃
┃    - Give each child a cardboard cutout shaped like a book. Assist them in decorating their "book" with crayons,       ┃
┃ markers, and family member stickers.                                                                                   ┃
┃    - Help them 'write' (with your help) the name of a family member on their book (e.g., "Mom," "Dad," "Sister"). For  ┃
┃ younger children, focus on recognizing and saying the words rather than writing.                                       ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 4. **Construct the Bookcase:**                                                                                         ┃
┃    - Arrange the decorated book cutouts on a large cardboard or bookshelf. Use Velcro or magnetic strips to attach     ┃
┃ laminated images of family members above each book on the bookcase to reinforce word-image association.                ┃
┃    - Encourage each child to "place" their book on the bookcase while saying the family word out loud.                 ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 5. **Role-Playing and Communication:**                                                                                 ┃
┃    - Set up a mini-pretend library corner with the bookcase activity where children can role-play being librarians and ┃
┃ patrons. They "check out" a family's book by announcing whom they are borrowing (e.g., "I am borrowing my sister").    ┃
┃    - Use this as an opportunity for them to practice using family vocabulary in sentences and listening to peer        ┃
┃ responses, enhancing turn-taking in communication.                                                                     ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 6. **Wrap-up and Reflection:**                                                                                         ┃
┃    - Gather the children back on the story mat and review the family words placed in the bookcase. Praise their        ┃
┃ efforts in naming and talking about family members.                                                                    ┃
┃    - End with a song about families, encouraging each child to mention a family member's role they learned during the  ┃
┃ activity (e.g., "This is the way we love our mom/dad/sister...").                                                      ┃

┃    - Encourage parents to reinforce these family words at home by creating a small family photo album with captions.   ┃
┃    - Suggest creating a simple family tree during drop-off time the following day, bringing in family photos to expand ┃
┃ the bookcase in the classroom.                                                                                         ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ **Outcome:** By organizing words in association with their family and placing them in a familiar setting like a        ┃
┃ bookcase, toddlers will strengthen their vocabulary while gaining an understanding of the roles and names within       ┃
┃ immediate family structures. The activity fosters both language acquisition and social interaction, making learning    ┃
┃ dynamic and personal.                                                                                                  ┃

┃ interaction, have adults/educators model and say words aloud with excitement.                                          ┃
┃    - Vary the pace—try walking, tip-toeing, and marching, using music as a guide. Pause sometimes to let them identify ┃
┃ and name the family member they're stepping on.                                                                        ┃

┃    - For older toddlers or as they become more familiar, introduce more complex vocabulary such as "grandmother,"      ┃
┃ "grandfather," and create corresponding footprints.                                                                    ┃
┃    - Encourage children to talk about their feelings towards these family members using simple sentences like, "I love ┃

┃ - Note their engagement with the activity and ability to follow directions.                                            ┃
┃ - Look for attempts to use the vocabulary in spontaneous speech throughout the day.                                    ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ Through the "Family Feet Parade," toddlers will have a fun and interactive way to link physical activity with language ┃

┃ - Throughout the week, during circle time or transitions, revisit the “Family Memories Wall” and ask different         ┃
┃ children to retell their family memory. This helps reinforce vocabulary and fosters pride in their stories.            ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃

┃ - Observe each child's ability to express their memory in words, engagement in the activity, and any increase in the   ┃
┃ use of new vocabulary.                                                                                                 ┃
┃ - Note the children’s interactions, evaluating their ability to listen and respond to friends’ stories.                ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ This activity not only works on language skills but also builds a sense of community within the classroom as children  ┃
┃ learn more about each other's lives.                                                                                   ┃

┃ 1. **Introduction**                                                                                                    ┃
┃    Begin with a warm-up circle time. Gather the toddlers in a circle on the floor and introduce the theme: "Immediate  ┃
┃ Family." Show the children the family-themed picture books and briefly talk about how families can look different but  ┃
┃ often include similar roles like mom, dad, brother, and sister.                                                        ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 2. **Creating Zones**                                                                                                  ┃
┃    Set up different “zones” in the play space by laying out the colored mats or fabric squares. Assign each zone to a  ┃
┃ different family member (e.g., Red Zone = Mom, Blue Zone = Dad, Green Zone = Brother, Yellow Zone = Sister). Place a   ┃
┃ corresponding photo or illustration in each zone for visual support.                                                   ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 3. **Exploring Zones**                                                                                                 ┃
┃    Invite toddlers to choose a zone to start. Encourage them to move from zone to zone, using soft blocks or cushions  ┃
┃ as stepping stones. As they reach each zone, prompt them to say the family member's name aloud using the microphone.   ┃
┃ Demonstrate this by saying, “This is the mom zone! Who else is in the mom class?”                                      ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 4. **Role Play & Interaction**                                                                                         ┃
┃    Encourage the children to role-play by mimicking what the family members might do. For example, in the "Mom Zone,"  ┃
┃ toddlers can pretend to cook. In the "Dad Zone," they might fix things. Offer props if available, and engage them with ┃
┃ questions, such as “What do you think mommy does when she cooks?” This aids in contextualizing verbs with family       ┃
┃ roles.                                                                                                                 ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 5. **Vocabulary Reinforcement**                                                                                        ┃
┃    Use the laminated picture cards. Hold up each card and ask the group to name the family member together or          ┃
┃ individually. Introduce descriptors, e.g., “This is a brother. Brothers can be big or small, young or old.”            ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 6. **Story Time**                                                                                                      ┃
┃    Gather children back into a circle and read one of the family-themed picture books. Pause frequently to point at    ┃
┃ illustrations and ask, “Who do you see?” or “What is brother doing?” to promote interaction.                           ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 7. **Closing Activity – Family Parade**                                                                                ┃
┃    Finish with a "Family Parade." Using the megaphone, lead the children around the room or space as they march with   ┃
┃ their picture cards, chanting each family member's name and making the associated role gesture, like waving hands for  ┃
┃ mom or pretending to drive for dad.                                                                                    ┃

┃    Begin by welcoming the children to the Closing Circle and briefly recount the activities of the day. Introduce the  ┃
┃ theme of "Immediate Family" and explain that they will get a chance to talk about their family members.                ┃

┃    Show a family photo (real or from a book) and talk about different family members. Encourage children to point out  ┃
┃ and name people in the picture—like "mommy," "daddy," "sister," or "brother." If available, the children can share     ┃
┃ pictures of their own family members.                                                                                  ┃

┃    Display props that relate to family roles, such as a doll to represent a sibling or a toy car for a traveling       ┃
┃ parent. Let the kids handle the props, and encourage them to connect them to people in their family—e.g., "This doll   ┃
┃ is like my baby sister."                                                                                               ┃

┃    - What is your mommy/daddy's name?                                                                                  ┃

┃    Encourage complete sentences by modeling: "I play with my sister," or "My mommy likes to cook."                     ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃

┃ pointing.                                                                                                              ┃

┃    Go around the circle and ask each child to say a word or two about something they learned or what they liked best   ┃
┃ about the activity. Use phrases like, "Today I learned..." or "I liked talking about...". Then, end with a group       ┃
┃ goodbye wave.                                                                                                          ┃

┃ - Adapt questions to suit different levels of language skills, providing more guidance as needed.                      ┃

┃    Give each child a large sheet of paper and crayons. Encourage them to draw their family, with prompts like, “Can    ┃

┃    Gather the group and sing a simple family-related song (e.g., "The Family Song”) to reinforce the vocabulary.       ┃

┃ "Wheels on the Bus") with actions for each family member (e.g., "Moms in the family say I love you…" with a hugging    ┃
┃ gesture).                                                                                                              ┃

┃    - Gather the toddlers in a circle. Start by introducing the theme of the week, "Immediate Family."                  ┃
┃    - Show them flashcards or pictures of different family members. As you name each, encourage the toddlers to repeat  ┃
┃ after you, emphasizing clear pronunciation of each family term.                                                        ┃
┃    - Ask questions such as "Who lives in your house?" to prompt the children to think about their own families and to  ┃
┃ use family-related vocabulary.                                                                                         ┃

┃    - Hand out the flashcards of family members to each toddler.                                                        ┃
┃    - Explain that when they see you holding up a picture of a family member, they should mimic an action associated    ┃
┃ with that person (e.g., waving for mom, pretending to read with grandpa).                                              ┃
┃    - Encourage them to say the word out loud as they perform the action.                                               ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃

┃    - Play upbeat songs and encourage toddlers to dance freely.                                                         ┃
┃    - During the music, randomly hold up a family member flashcard; when the toddlers see it, they perform the          ┃
┃ associated movement and say the word.                                                                                  ┃
┃    - For example, hold up "mom" and the toddlers could wave and say "mommy!" or "mama!"                                ┃
┃    - Repeat with different family members, keeping the energy high and the movements dynamic.                          ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 4. **Cool Down and Reflect (5 minutes):**                                                                              ┃
┃    - Slow down the music and encourage toddlers to sit in a circle again.                                              ┃
┃    - Go around the circle and ask each child to name a family member and do a movement or say something special about  ┃
┃ them.                                                                                                                  ┃
┃    - Use this time to reinforce the vocabulary learned and praise their participation.                                 ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ **Tips for Success:**                                                                                                  ┃
┃ - Keep the atmosphere lively and encouraging.                                                                          ┃
┃ - Offer gentle correction if a toddler mispronounces a word, but always praise their effort.                           ┃
┃ - Use the language related to actions to enhance dual learning (e.g., "Can you hop like brother does?")                ┃
┃ - If a child is shy, allow them to participate at their own pace.                                                      ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ **Adaptation for Different Levels:**                                                                                   ┃
┃ - For more advanced toddlers, introduce adjectives (e.g., "kind mom," "funny dad") to enrich vocabulary.               ┃
┃ - For younger toddlers, simplify by focusing on only two or three family members to avoid overwhelming them.           ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ By engaging in this activity, toddlers not only learn about family roles and vocabulary but also enhance their         ┃
┃ communication skills through interactive and physical play.                                                            ┃

┃    - Encourage each child to choose their favorite animal from the ones they've learned and describe it using the      ┃
┃ family terms (e.g., "I liked the Baby Elephant, it stomps!").                                                          ┃

┃ - Use basic sentences related to family and the animal movement for children ready to advance (e.g., "Papa Bear is big ┃
┃ and strong!").                                                                                                         ┃

┃ 1. **Introduction (5 minutes):**                                                                                       ┃
┃    Begin by gathering the toddlers in a circle. Show them each picture card and clearly say the name of the family     ┃
┃ member. Encourage them to repeat after you: "This is a mother," "This is a father," and so on.                         ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 2. **Exploration and Vocabulary (10 minutes):**                                                                        ┃
┃    Invite the children to explore each zone. Encourage them to pick up the plush toys or dolls and match them with the ┃
┃ picture cards in each zone. As they do this, help them associate the toys with words by saying, "This is where the     ┃
┃ father goes," or "Find the sister's zone." Reinforce the words by repeating them and encouraging the children to say   ┃
┃ them out loud.                                                                                                         ┃

┃ 3. **Interactive Play (5 minutes):**                                                                                   ┃
┃    Introduce a small basket or box. Have the children walk from zone to zone and collect the dolls or toys in it. As   ┃
┃ they pick each one, ask them questions like, "Who did you find?" Encourage them to answer with the family member's     ┃
┃ name.                                                                                                                  ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 4. **Communication and Role Play (10 minutes):**                                                                       ┃
┃    Encourage the children to use the hand mirror to look at themselves and say, "I am a brother," or "I am a sister,"  ┃
┃ relating to their role in the family. Allow them to role-play by pretending to be different family members. For        ┃
┃ instance, a child can pretend to be a father by saying something simple like, "I am Dad. I play with the ball."        ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃
┃ 5. **Wrap-Up (5 minutes):**                                                                                            ┃
┃    Gather everyone in a circle again and review the family members. Play a simple toss-the-doll game where each child  ┃
┃ tosses a doll back into the correct zone and says, "This is the grandmother," encouraging both vocabulary use and      ┃
┃ motor skills. Conclude by singing a simple family song or rhyme that mentions family members, reinforcing the          ┃
┃ vocabulary learned.                                                                                                    ┃

┃ **Additional Tips:**                                                                                                   ┃
┃ - Encourage parents to continue the activity at home by identifying family photos and naming members together.         ┃
┃ - Ensure the environment is safe and comfortable, accommodating toddlers at different language development stages.     ┃

┃                                                                                                                        ┃

┃    - Hand out stickers or cut-out shapes to each child. Invite them to come up one by one and place a sticker on the   ┃
┃ family tree poster as they say the name of the family member they are placing. Encourage sentences: "This is my        ┃
┃ sister."                                                                                                               ┃

┃ quickly as they can.                                                                                                   ┃
┃    - Conclude with a goodbye song that includes waving to different family members (e.g., "Goodbye, Mommy! Goodbye,    ┃
┃ Daddy!")                                                                                                               ┃

┃    - Gather toddlers around in a circle and show them the blank photo album.                                           ┃
┃    - Introduce each family member's picture one by one, using simple vocabulary. For example, "This is Mommy," "Here   ┃
┃ is Grandpa."                                                                                                           ┃
┃    - Hand out a pre-printed picture to each toddler, one at a time. Encourage them to describe who they see using      ┃
┃ words they know, e.g., "Daddy," "Sister."                                                                              ┃
┃    - Assist toddlers in placing each picture into the photo album using glue or tape. Use this moment to repeat the    ┃

┃                                                                                                                        ┃

┃    - Encourage toddlers to add a sticker or draw a simple symbol (like a heart or smiley face) next to each family     ┃
┃ picture.                                                                                                               ┃
┃    - Help children label the pictures by either identifying the family members or asking open-ended questions like,    ┃
┃ "Who is this with you at the park?"                                                                                    ┃

┃    - Once the album is complete, sit with the toddlers and browse through the photo album together, discussing the     ┃
┃ relationships and sharing any stories they want to tell.                                                               ┃
┃    - Prompt with questions like, "Who's missing?" or "Who is the tallest in your family?" to encourage toddlers to use ┃
┃ vocabulary words and form basic sentences.                                                                             ┃

┃    - End the session by playing a simple family-themed rhyme or song again. Encourage toddlers to participate by       ┃
┃ singing along or mimicking gestures associated with family members (e.g., waving for "hello").                         ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃

┃    - Send each child home with a small piece of paper encouraging parents to continue this activity by asking children ┃
┃ to identify family members in their own photo albums at home. This helps reinforce the lesson and encourages           ┃
┃ parent-child bonding.                                                                                                  ┃

┃ - Use plenty of animation and facial expressions to keep toddlers engaged.                                             ┃
┃ - Encourage all attempts at communication, praising efforts and correcting gently.                                     ┃
┃ - Be attentive to individual needs; some toddlers might need more encouragement than others.                           ┃
┃                                                                                                                        ┃

┃ and family dynamics, enhancing both their cognitive and social development.                                            ┃
